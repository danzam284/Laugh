    <H1>Hi, I am Galvin Johnson</H1>
        I am a Computer Science student at Murray State University. I am happy to participate in this weekend's hackathon.
    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Computer Science student here at Murray State University. When I am not partaking in hackathons, I am either working on my coursework in the honors college program of my unviversity, or with my student organizatons. These include Association for Computing Machinery, Association for Information Technology Professionals, Association for Women in Mathematics, and the National Society of Leadership Scholars.</p>
    <h1>Our Project</h1>
        <p>I took part as best I could in the project this weekend to provide the front-end display of this page you see now, as well as to work out the object-oriented manner in which the JokeAPI operates.</p>
